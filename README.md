# What I learned
- To create widget tests using the widget testing framework
- To create an integration test to test the app's UI and performance using the integration_test library
- To test data classes (providers) with the help of unit tests


# Performing Test On

- Widgets tests for the home and favorites pages
- UI and performance tests for the entire app using integration tests
