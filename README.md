# What I learned
- To create widget tests using the widget testing framework
- To create an integration test to test the app's UI and performance using the integration_test library
- To test data classes (providers) with the help of unit tests


# Performing Test On
- Unit tests to validate the add and remove operations
- Widgets tests for the home and favorites pages
- UI and performance tests for the entire app using integration tests

# Keynotes
- A unit test verifies that every individual unit of software, be it a function, object or a widget, performs its intended task correctly
- All the test files in a Flutter app, except for integration tests, are placed in the test directory.
